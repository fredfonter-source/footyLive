# ⚽ FootyLive — Premium Live Sports Streaming Aggregator

FootyLive is a high-performance, ad-free live football streaming aggregator built on Next.js 14. It aggregates live scoreboard metrics, team logistics, and dynamic multi-server stream networks into a premium, glassmorphic client interface. 

Designed for low latency and high quality, FootyLive resolves streaming server links on the fly, provides direct `.m3u8` video player fallbacks with client-side HLS rendering, integrates ad-blocker sandboxes, and implements a dashboard to stream multiple matches simultaneously.

## 🌟 Key Features

* 📺 **Interactive Stream Player**: Auto-detects direct stream formats (HLS/m3u8/mp4) and uses `hls.js` for native low-latency playback, alongside regular streaming iframe nodes equipped with togglable **sandbox shields** to block intrusive pop-ups and ads.
* ⚡ **Multistream Arena**: Stream up to 4 matches at the same time in a responsive drag-to-resize viewport grid with isolated volume controls and reload capabilities.
* 📅 **Match Lifecycle Management**: Split layout for **Live Now** (auto-refreshing score lists) and **Upcoming** fixtures (with real-time kickoff countdowns).
* 🔍 **Smart Tournament Filters**: A horizontal, swipeable tournament shelf with team logos, custom click-to-scroll navigation chevrons, and dynamic league-hiding (only showing leagues that have active matches in the current tab).
* ⭐ **Favorite Teams Tracking**: Star your favorite teams to pin their fixtures at the top of your dashboard automatically.
* 🌓 **Premium Dark Mode**: Seamless theme switching using custom glassmorphic elements, rich visual glows, and harmonized color systems (no plain primaries).
